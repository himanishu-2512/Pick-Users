# About Project
This Project is made using React , Tailwind CSS.

### Functionalities Implemented:-

- [X]  When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
- [X]  As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
- [X]  Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
- [X]  Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
- [X] Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

### Bonus Functionalities:-
- [X] When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip  should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted.



### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
